## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13+0u0kjgpd6TIDdcv0oakmu-ec
Your Rationale: I would use a soft-blue monochromatic scheme. A new gaming console would be marketed as cutting edge space-age technology. The fastest and the most powerful stuff. Shades of blue are representative of the colors of the sky, deep space or the deep sea. All of which require the best technology to explore. 

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52P0X0kiyv66yScd0FWngq+rBlq
Your Rationale: This color scheme of greens, blues and yellows reflect the full bloom of nature and the colors of grandma's garden in the Spring.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=35y0X0ko6uuccLFiU-Jt-qnwmjQ
Your Rationale: Clear and distinct colors, that are also fun and child-like. Simple, but bright and lively.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13L0f0kkZmF8jCReVsCquhzylbl
Your Rationale: a reminiscent color scheme of the Kali-Linux distribution of Linux, which is a cyber security distro.
