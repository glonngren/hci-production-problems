## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list
of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your group’s interface from Project Two**. Share with
your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1. UX Project Checklist: http://uxchecklist.github.io/
2. W3  Checklist: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html

* Your own condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklists
1. Ensure that foreground and background color combinations provide
   sufficient contrast when viewed by someone having color deficits or when viewed on a black and white screen.
2. When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than
   images to convey information.
3. Use navigation mechanisms in a consistent manner.
4. Ensure that dynamic content is accessible or provide an
   alternative presentation or page.
5. Ensure that pages are usable when scripts, applets, or
   other programmatic objects are turned off or not supported.     
   If this is not possible, provide equivalent information on
   an alternative accessible page.
6. Reuse elements and patterns. Follow your style guidelines.
7. Give immediate and clear feedback of successful user's actions.
   Do not always wait for server response, trust your server once in a while!
8. You don’t need to add extra functionality or to duplicate any
   content. The key is simply to assess the requirements of those with different skills and limited devices.
9. Motion shouldn't be only beautiful, it should build
   meaning about the spatial relationships, functionality, and intention of the system.
10. Don't Force Registration
